## What Is PII, non-PII, and Personal Data?

1. PPI (personally identifiable information) is any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including (1) any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual‘s identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother‘s maiden name, or biometric records; and (2) any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information.

### What pieces of information are considered PII?
According to NIST, PII can be divided into two categories: linked and linkable information.

Linked information is more direct. It could include any personal detail that can be used to identify an individual. Examples of this kind of PII include:

1. Full name

2. Home address

3. Email address

4. Social security number

5. Passport number

6. Driver’s license number

7. Credit card numbers

8. Date of birth

9. Telephone number

10. Owned properties e.g. vehicle identification number (VIN) 

11. Login details

12. Processor or device serial number* 

13. Media access control (MAC)*

14. Internet Protocol (IP) address*

15. Device IDs*  

16. Cookies*


Linkable information is indirect and on its own may not be able to identify a person, but when combined with another piece of information could identify, trace or locate a person. 

Here are some examples of PII that can be considered linkable information:

1. First or last name (if common)

2. Country, state, city, zip code

3. Gender

4. Race

5. Non-specific age (e.g. 30-40 instead of 30)

6. Job position and workplace


What is non-PII?

Non-personally identifiable information (non-PII) is data that cannot be used on its own to trace, or identify a person.Examples of non-PII include, but are not limited to:

1. Aggregated statistics on the use of product / service

2. Partially or fully masked IP addresses

However, the classification of PII and non-PII is vague. Moreover, NIST doesn’t reference cookie IDs and device IDs, so many AdTech companies, advertisers, and publishers consider them as non-PII. As we’ll see, this is in contrast to the definition of personal data, which treats such digital tackers as information that could identify an individual.

What is personal data?

personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;

And the definition of personal data covers various pieces of information such as:

transaction history
IP addresses
browser history 
posts on social media
Basically, it’s any information relating to an individual or identifiable person, directly or indirectly.

What is non-personal data?
Following the GDPR provisions, non-personal data is data that won’t let you identify an individual.

Other examples of non-personal data include, but are not limited to:

Generalized data, e.i. age range e.g. 20-40
Information gathered by government bodies or municipalities such as census data or tax receipts collected for publicly funded works
Aggregated statistics on the use of a product or service
Partially or fully masked IP addresses
